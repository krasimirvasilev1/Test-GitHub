                        <h3><span><strong>Brexit</strong></span> and <span><strong>Trump</strong></span> have forced the EU to listen to its critics and change, admit its top officials</h3>

                        The shock of Brexit and Donald Trump’s rise is forcing Europe to tackle the deep problems that drove Britons to vote Leave, the EU’s most senior officials have admitted.

                        Just as polls begin to signal the UK may want to stay in the union, the European Commission’s chief strategists said the bloc now realises it must fundamentally change to remain relevant to people's lives.

                        Writing exclusively for The Independent, Jean-Claude Juncker’s top officials argue the EU is becoming more open, democratic and is certain the future “must not be fudged or decided behind closed doors”.
                        They directed their message to the British people as Mr Juncker prepares to announce new details of how Europe will transform over the next decade and after a string of member state leaders signalled the door is still open if the UK wishes to be a part of the new future.

                        The full complexity of a UK withdrawal became starker this week, with the Government 's approach to the EU's nuclear agency in chaos amid ominous signs of a Brexit hit UK economy and after the European Parliament saying it would veto Theresa May's opening proposals.

                        Ministers are also due to publish their key piece of Brexit legislation on Thursday, the Repeal Bill, marking the start of a two-year struggle for Ms May to pass one of the most complex legislative programmes in British history, on a shaky Commons majority propped up by the Democratic Unionist Party.
                        In their article, Mr Juncker’s head of political strategy Ann Mettler and deputy head Pawel Swieboda tell how after a “decade of crisis”, Europeans have rediscovered optimism and are ready to improve the bloc.

                        They specifically cite chaos surrounding the UK’s decision to quit the EU and Mr Trump’s election in the US as moments that shook Europe to up its game.

                        Pointing to the dual political crisis in Britain and the US, they write: “If anyone wondered what checking out of Europe or weakening multilateralism leads to, it is now clear for everyone to see – from increased investment uncertainty and an hitherto unknown degree of division within society, to the potential political fallout for countries so far admired around the world as beacons of democracy and freedom.”

                        They add: “There is now a strong sense that Europeans – having had a glimpse of the alternative – are ready to invest in our common project.
                        “They realise that disintegration, illiberal democracy and populism are profoundly dangerous to our democratic traditions – the freedom and tolerance painstakingly built over decades, which has at times been taken for granted.”

                        Critical to now bringing “fresh vitality” and “legitimacy” to the EU will be taking a decision on which of Mr Juncker’s five options for Europe’s future to follow.

                        The different paths were outlined in a white paper in March just days before Theresa May triggered Article 50, and were broadly entitled “carrying on”, “nothing but the single market”, “those who want more do more”, “doing less more efficiently” and “doing much more together”.

                        Mr Juncker’s officials write: “Unlike in the past, the Commission has not itself stated which of the five scenarios is its preferred policy blueprint.
