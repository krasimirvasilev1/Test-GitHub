                    <h3><span><strong>Donald Trump</strong></span> says his son is 'innocent' as he faces accusations of treason over email scandal - but Russia says it 'knows nothing'</h3>
                </header>
<p>
    President Donald Trump on Wednesday defended his son Donald Trump Jr, describing him as "innocent" and portraying him as the victim of a witch hunt.

    His intervention followed revelations in emails that showed his eldest son welcomed Russian help against his father's rival in last year's presidential election.

    "My son Donald did a good job last night," Mr Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to a Fox News television interview by his son on Tuesday night.

    "He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!"

    But it came as the New York Times reported that Mr Trump Jr's initial comments on the story, published by the paper on Sunday, were drafted on board Air Force One and were signed off by the president.

    That statement was vague and inconclusive, and did not draw a line under the story. Instead, it led to days of further damaging revelations.

                    <h3><span><strong>Brexit</strong></span> and <span><strong>Trump</strong></span> have forced the EU to listen to its critics and change, admit its top officials</h3>
                </header>
                <p>
                    The shock of Brexit and Donald Trump’s rise is forcing Europe to tackle the deep problems that drove Britons to vote Leave, the EU’s most senior officials have admitted.

                    Just as polls begin to signal the UK may want to stay in the union, the European Commission’s chief strategists said the bloc now realises it must fundamentally change to remain relevant to people's lives.

                    Writing exclusively for The Independent, Jean-Claude Juncker’s top officials argue the EU is becoming more open, democratic and is certain the future “must not be fudged or decided behind closed doors”.
                    They directed their message to the British people as Mr Juncker prepares to announce new details of how Europe will transform over the next decade and after a string of member state leaders signalled the door is still open if the UK wishes to be a part of the new future.

                    The full complexity of a UK withdrawal became starker this week, with the Government 's approach to the EU's nuclear agency in chaos amid ominous signs of a Brexit hit UK economy and after the European Parliament saying it would veto Theresa May's opening proposals.

                    Ministers are also due to publish their key piece of Brexit legislation on Thursday, the Repeal Bill, marking the start of a two-year struggle for Ms May to pass one of the most complex legislative programmes in British history, on a shaky Commons majority propped up by the Democratic Unionist Party.
